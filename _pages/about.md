I am a Machine Learning Researcher / Engineer at Google Research. My current research focus is vision and language multimodal learning to solve various V&L downstream tasks in a multilingual environment.

I obtained my PhD in applied physics and MS in applied math from Harvard and received a BS in physics from Peking University.
